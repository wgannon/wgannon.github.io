# Updates
1. I want to change the styling to something not out of box and cleaner
    will need to sample a few colors, textures, and fonts.
    A few off the top of my head could be Nasa, Rustic, Synth/Retrowave and plain off white
    UPDATE: Choose Nasa Color Theme and Space Font type
2. I want to change how the landing page looks on load to either take up the whole page.
    UPDATE: Currently Am exploring sizing with The Landing page and will need to change the style of the North Arrow I created.
3. Update my about information.
4. Update Resume portion to also have it graphically show not as a download but have it as an option
    and also have something that sends a notification everytime the button for download is hit. 
    Update the resume itself plus create seperate ones for various positions like GIS Analyst/Specialist, Web Developer, ect.
5. Decide if I want a working contact me form.
    UPDATED: I don't...
6. Correct the links to github account. Remove twitter handle until you can review it all. 
    UPDATE: I think I reviewed it all but will remove it as it's not a "proffesional" twitter account. 
7. Add more projects to the portfolio, clean up previous projects and repost them. Also in the gallery make them smaller boxes
    and outlined, don't forget to change the hover over from the default theme. 
    UPDATE: still need to change sizing but added all Grad Projects to the portfolio. 
    GOALS: Will try to organize projects by either class or skill instead of Individuallly?
